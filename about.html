      "Hi All, My name is Belinda.
      I grew up in Bern, the capital of Switzerland.
      I studied international business and economics and discovered 
      recently an interest and curiosty in learning programming. 
      I started hiking a few years ago and directly felt in love with this personally enriching activity. 
      However, finding inspiration is not so simple as nowadays we get easily caught in information overload. 
      Nonetheless, I get truly inspired by personal recommendations and travel blogs, which in my opinion give you a real glimpse of the hike or visit. 
      Even though, pictures only capture a glimpse of the natural beauty and sensation you may feel, they give you the inspiration to simply go for the experience. 
      My experiences were of course chosen based on my physical condition and aspiration. 
      I hope they help inspire you.
